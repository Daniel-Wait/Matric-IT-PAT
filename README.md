# Matric-IT-PAT

The code herein was my IT Practical Assessment Task for Grade 12.
The task was to create an ICT system which would improve the quality of healthcare services.

I chose to create a computerized system for the local public hospital, Frere, which is poorly equipped technologically.
The idea was to have a program and database for login which had security levels to acess relevant sections to manage patients and staff.
My inspitration came from the arduous process of managing diabetic patients who require strict monitoring - a challenge my mother was responsible for.
The program has a functioning form for the diabetic clinic as proof of concept.
